# create an empty list and add elements (0, 1, 4, 9, 16) in it in a
# loop
# Find the largest and smalless elements from this list. Do not
# use min() and max() functions. Use a loop.
# Traverse the list elements in a loop and break the loop when
# the match is found.
# Traverse the list in a loop and find how many occurrences of a
# given element exist.
# Traverse the list and remove the required element.
